Justification for the design decision.

- SQLite database is used for the data storage.
SQLite is a relational database management system that is easy to use, since it's a document with no 
required installations or configurations. All that is required to use it, is a simple python library sqlite3 
(which is used for this application). This therefore suits the data storage requirement for applications for the task.

- Pandas library
Pandas library for data manipulation and analysis. It has a 2 dimensional data structure called a dataframe. 
This dataframe has methods which allow reading of csv files to dataframes and transfering of data from dataframes to databases, 
which are the requirements for the first task.
There are other helpful methods which were used in the cleaning of the data. These include
 1. Having conistent precision for the values in the temperature column. 
    i.e all values having the same number of decimal places.
 2. Removing the suffix on the timestamp, since this is common for all values, 
    removing the suffix makes values appear clearer given the differnce between them is a second.
 3. Having the ID column start from 1, rather than the current value, sinc this is all the data we have.
 4. Removing the prefix of `0 days` from the duration column, this too is common for all values.

- Flask mirco-framework
Flask is a micro-framework for building web applications. 
It designed to make getting started quick and easy(as stated here https://github.com/pallets/flask).
This framework suits the this a task, as application development and design are quick.

The other factors for selection of some of the tools used, is influenced by the tools that are used at smart steel technologies.
